    "Title": "The Art of Asking Questions with Oya Günay",
    "Version": 2,
    "Body": "We have become more and more aware that asking questions are the “cine qua non” of building positive relationships.\r\nWith the help of countless techniques and methods we think we know how to ask questions. However, we often fail to accept our questions are just another form of telling - excepting the other party to hit the answer in our minds. In this workshop, we were off to a journey to reflect on our awareness of the oft-neglected foundations, which play a key role in asking questions.\r\nAn inspiring member of the TurkishWIN brain trust and executive coach Oya Günay, hosted a learning circle to guide us to a mindset- to able to ask the right questions on May 31, 2018 in Istanbul. She has been a member of TurkishWIN since 2010!\r\n\r\nOya first told us a story about three people- giving us a two-minute glimpse from their daily life. When invited to complete the picture, an interactive session followed. As you can guess, we all had so many assumptions after hearing a two- minute story!\r\nFirst lesson: Dear friend- you shall not assume, if you are genuinely curious about the other, when asking questions.\r\nWe walked through three basic elements for asking questions, we mean good questions:\r\nFirst, acceptance of one’s reality is most crucial. Accept, do not assume, do not judge. Consider the reality of that person from his/her lens. Unless you are in the acceptance mindset and approach someone with open, non-judging questions, they will not answer your question openly and with real answers. Why not? People communicate openly only when they don’t feel threatened.\r\nGetting to this mindset is not as easy as it sounds. Believe us, we tried to ask these questions with some interactive exercises! Judgment creeps in so quickly.\r\nSecond, bring along that curiosity.  Kids are so curious. As we grow up, we leave that curiosity behind. Sad but true.\r\nWell, Oya showed us some awesome pictures to tickle that curiosity and we asked away open questions.\r\nThird, slow down. Well, what is your physical distance from the person you are asking a question to? How quickly do you roll these questions?  \r\nPhysical interaction deserves some physical distance. Mind the gap to make the other party feel comfortable. And there is a very fine line between questioning and investigating.  When you ask questions one after another, not pacing yourself, you may have switched to investigation mode, beware!\r\nLast but not least, be brave while asking questions and create your own style.\r\nOya had remarked that TurkishWIN learning circles have been a constant in her life- attending or giving one- in the ups and downs of life and events around us. She added: “These sharing circles give me hope and I know there are people like me caring about their self-development as well as the society. Every time, I am filled with hope and leave with hope at TurkishWIN.”\r\nWell, dear Oya Gunay, thank you for boosting our confidence in the generosity of women like you- sharing their know-how to help another sister! Thank you for this awesome learning circle – we all reflected and took away something home and to our hearts.\r\nWe also thank our venue partner, Joint Idea, for hosting this event.\r\nYou can stay updated about upcoming TurkishWIN events by joining our newsletter here or joining us a TurkishWINer!  (add links please)\r\nMay inspiration and sisterhood be always with you… ",

We all have or need mentors along the way.\r\nLucky for all of us, our MentorWIN program is getting better day by day thanks to many :) Here are our latest updates:\r\nReverse Mentoring Summit \r\nWe were one of the partners of the Bahcesehir University & Unilever Reverse Mentoring Summit that took place on April 26, 2018 at Bahcesehir University.\r\nThe timing of the event was perfect, right after our latest reverse mentoring matches for the summer! If you missed this application period, we will have them coming, now worries. \r\nOzlem Yesildere, Assistant General Manager at Koton Magazicilik, and Merve Kose, senior student at Galatasaray University, participated at the BAU & Unilever Reverse Mentoring Summit. Here is a recap of what they shared:\r\n“TurkishWIN matched me with a brilliant young lady with a very relevant background.  I was able to receive very effective mentoring on my “Generation Y & Z ” challenges (applicable to work and home!), and most importantly, I was able to get to know an extremely wise young person.  Thank you “TurkishWIN”! said Ozlem Yesildere.\r\n\"Reverse mentoring is full of experiences about advising the skills that you feel confortable in your daily life. You should be prepared every questions that your mentee can ask and you will get the challenging idea of this reverse sprit! \" shared Merve Kose.\r\n\r\nJoin us at MentorWIN Events:\r\nWe invite and encourage you to take an addictive approach to mentoring. TurkishWIN provides development activities for our mentors and mentees. Our next events is about ‘curiosity’.\r\nCuriosity begins with a thought and typically what follows is a question. As you discover your mentee’s world and her challenges, asking the right questions can make your mentoring journey a transformative one! On May 31st, we will be off to a learning circle on “The Art of Asking Questions” led by Oya Günay  in Istanbul. In Oya’s words “ We have become more and more aware that asking questions is the sine qua non of building positive relationships. With the help of countless techniques and methods, we think we know how to ask questions. However we often fail to accept our questions are just another form of telling - excepting the other party to hit the answer in our minds. In this workshop, I will help attendees increase their awareness of the oft-neglected  foundations which play a key role in asking questions.’\r\nRSVP here to boost your curiosity!\r\nOur mentoring program has rolling admission and matching process. If you are new to the program, would like to join or refresh your knowhow, you can join our MentorWIN Refresher event with Mine Yücesoy in June 19th in Istanbul.  RSVP here and come along!\r\nPlease welcome new mentors and mentees!",

As you discover your mentee’s world and her challenges, asking the right questions can make your mentoring journey a transformative one! <strong>On May 31<sup>st</sup>, we will be off to a learning circle on “The Art of Asking Questions” led by Oya Günay&nbsp; in Istanbul.</strong> In Oya’s words “ <em>We have become more and more aware that asking questions is the sine qua non of building positive relationships. With the help of countless techniques and methods, we think we know how to ask questions. However we often fail to accept our questions are just another form of telling - excepting the other party to hit the answer in our minds. In this workshop, I will help attendees increase their awareness of the oft-neglected&nbsp; foundations which play a key role in asking questions.’</em></p>\r\n<p>RSVP <a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/learning-circle-the-art-of-asking-questions-understanding-the-role-of-curiosity-in-questioning-tickets-45714466199\">here</a> to boost your curiosity!</p>\r\n<p>Our mentoring program has rolling admission and matching process.

    "Body": "How hard is it to start from scratch? Isn’t it beautiful to change the game and redefine yourself?\r\nTurkishWIN@London co-hosted the “Starting from Scratch” event with EY Turkic Network on May 15, 2018.  It was a lovely spring day in London and despite the beautiful weather the room was full. Participants were from EY, TurkishWIN@London network and London CampusWINners.   \r\nOur moderator, Aynur Taskan from EY, introduced the theme for the event and our speakers, who were all from different backgrounds. Esin Cittone, a creative director and a big time traveler, told us her story with a slingshot, plastic dinosaur, folded piece of paper and deck of cards. She said “Don’t fear the change. Never look back and always look forward”.  Jane Musyoki, a Director in the Financial Accounting Advisory Services at EY, told us how she moved from Kenya to London and noted “we need mentors to help us, challenge us and tell us where we did terribly wrong. Eventually they will cheer for you when you leave the meeting room”. A newbie to London Pelin Opcin, the new director of London Jazz Festival, said “I see being a newbie as an advantage. I can be blunt, ask the “stupid question” and also benefit from others’ experiences.”\r\n\r\nThere was a lively panel discussion led by Aynur Taskan, which was followed by Q&A.  Afterwards, TurkishWINners and EY attendees had a chance to mingle until we were kicked-out of the venue. But the party did not end there. We had dinner and more drinks together after the event.\r\nA big thank you to EY and TurkishWIN teams for this event. It was really inspirational to listen to three amazing women.\r\n“You may be late to the party,but grab a drink and join the crowd. There will always be someone to lend a hand to you.”  \r\n ",

    "Title": "What! A game to solve the Middle East Conflict?",
    "Version": 2,
    "Body": "This  was the first reaction when people heard about Asi Burak’s master thesis. Asi is the CEO of Power Play and the Chairman of Games for Change.\r\nImage a world where  video-games can tackle on social problems!  On May 8th, we attentively listened to Asi tell his story. He started his game adventure by designing and launching Peacemaker, a game where players  can choose to take the role of either the Israeli Prime Minister or the Palestinian President, react to in-game events, and interact with other political leaders and social groups to establish a stable resolution to the conflict. The goal of the game is to promote peace and have you wear the other one’s shoes.\r\nAsi found it really interesting that a lot of people engaged in the challenge and were not doing so great in  bringing peace. “I now know more about the conflict than what I’ve read newspaper for years”, said people only after playing the game for two hours. Asi shared: “ It is difficult to see the big picture from news because individual events don’t give us the real context. We cannot see the wood for the trees.”\r\nDeveloping empathy is one of the most profound objectives of the game Peacemaker. In the game, the Israel side has all the resources and it occupies territories, while the Palestinian side has limited resources and symbolizes independence. The players wear each side’s shoes. They also know that there is never one right way.\r\n\r\nAfter Peacemaker, Asi launched the Games for Change platform as one of the cofounders. Founded in 2004, Games for Change empowers game creators and social innovators to drive real-world change using games and technology that help people to learn, improve their communities, and contribute to make the world a better place.  His recent book, “Power Play, ”profiles trailblazers who believe in the power of  video games. He shared a few stories and we met these real life heros: Sandra Day O'Connor, a former Supreme Court. When she asked children what the three different branches of the government, they didn’t know. However, they could list the names of three judges at the American Idol show. Determined to make a difference and to tap into what kids pay attention to, she started iCivics, a nonprofit civics education group, in 2009. The group has since released over 19 free online games, along with accompanying lesson plans, with the idea of making civics education less about rote learning and more about giving middle school students an animated glimpse into how different branches of government and the Constitution work. Millions of students play iCivics games. Other trail blazers in the book are as colorful: a Saudi prince, Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn, who are Pulitzer Prize-winning journalists,  a brain scientist and others.\r\n\r\nVirtual reality is the ultimate empathy enabler. Last year, the United Nations added a new tool to its fundraising arsenal: virtual reality. With the help of studio Vrse.works, it released Clouds Over Sidra, a mini-documentary following a 12-year-old Syrian refugee. You can watch it here. : https://www.dragons.org/clouds-over-sidra/\r\nNext, Asi captured our imagination by suggesting that we may be prescribed games not medicine for healing and changes in the way our brain works in the near future. What’s next? Neuro – gaming. Neuro-gaming – uses brain-computer interfaces to play a game rather than traditional controllers and  may have the potential to improve patient health.  In clinical studies with U.S. army veterans, who are also burn victims, the subjects played a game in the 3D virtual world of SnowWorld and reported significantly less pain in play time. Neuro-gaming will arrive in our daily lives soon!\r\nLast, Asi shared with us some of the projects he led in “e-sports,” and how people are now coming together to play video games as a sport – in stadiums, as teams and with sponsors. The love of gaming knows no boundaries.\r\nAt the end of the  learning circle, we asked for some book recommendations. For conflict resolution, a good book is “The Triangle of Truth: The Surprisingly Simple Secret to Resolving Conflicts Large and Small” by Lisa Earle McLeod and “The Distracted Mind: Ancient Brains in a High-Tech World” by Adam Gazzaley for neuro gaming. \r\nWe had a very interactive session and thank Asi Burak for spending time with us in his short visit from New York!\r\nWe thank BAU COOP for hosting us at the Bahcesehir University.\r\n ",

    "Version": 2,
    "Body": "Our San Francisco chapter is bubbling with activities – as always. This month they hosted a great Facebook live event with Dilek Dayinlarli on April 18th.\r\nDilek Dayinlarli is a woman of firsts! She is one of the few female venture capital firm founders in Turkey. One of the few women VCs in the world. Dilek is the first Founder of ScaleX Ventures, a Hurriyet columnist, a Kauffman Fellow and a founding member and leader of Arya Women Investment Platform.\r\nAs a mechanical engineering student at Yildiz Technical University, Dilek was used to being one of the few women in the room.

    "Title": "Neuro Leadership: Manage Your Brain, Manager Your Self",
    "Version": 2,
    "Body": "Our curator, Yaprak Metin, hosted Tülin Kahvecioğlu to talk about “Neuro Leadership” as part of our young professional learning series. The sooner a young manager knows about neuro leadership, the better! \r\nOn April 17th, had a feast for our brain and our soul. Tülin Kahvecioğlu shared her own story and her career choices to get our imagination flowing. Starting her career at the age of 18, she wore many hats that includes being a flight attendant to now coaching leaders.  Tülin is the Co-Founder of BahçeBiz Gelişim Akademisi.\r\nNext, we dived into the world of Neuro leadership and the magic world of our brain.\r\nWhat is our motivation? \r\n If you want to turn your success into something sustainable and continuous,\r\n If you believe that succeeding as a group is more important than your individual success,\r\n If you can avoid your ego to give credit to those who come up with the idea;\r\nThen you are aware that failures are always the best lessons and you are in your leadership journey.\r\nTulin added: \"It all comes down to where you want to position yourself and have confidence for this ideal. All the guidance you need and what you want to learn from others should stem within.\"\r\nMaster your brain, master your today and future \r\n “Visualization works because brain doesn’t exactly differentiate between reality and imagination. When you start visualizing the future, your brain starts laying the future steps for your goals.\r\nKnowing what you want from life and where you see yourself in the future has great importance. You can't be a leader with low self-awareness. Questioning yourself is one crucial activity that should never end.”  Were Tülin’s introductory remarks. \r\n\r\nDid you SCARF today? \r\nShe then introduced us to the SCARF model of behavior, first published in 2008 by David Rock.\r\nThe SCARF model is based on two assumptions: 1) Our brain switches in between two states: minimize threats and maximize rewards. 2) The brain takes a threat and reward approach to social needs in the same way it reacts to primary needs, such as food and water.\r\nWhat does that mean for a leader? You can use the SCARF model to plan interactions with others and use the technique to motivate your team.\r\n In a nutshell, if a person feels that they are being threatened, their primitive emotional brain – particularly the amygdala – will work quickly to protect them, and this reduces their ability for rational thought, to make decisions, to solve problems, and to collaborate. As leaders, we would like to inspire the opposite!  \r\nA positive emotion or reward creates a stimulus making people act, encouraging them to perform to realize their potential.\r\nSCARF stands for:\r\nStatus – the relative importance to others.\r\nCertainty – the ability to predict future.\r\nAutonomy – the sense of control over events.\r\nRelatedness – the sense of safety with others.\r\nFairness – the perception of fair exchanges.\r\nIf you find yourself at acts listed below, you are triggering an avoidance response from your team and move further away from coaching them to realize their own potential:\r\n\r\nMicro management (challenges autonomy)\r\nGiving constant feedback and not allowing your team member to give feedback about themselves (challenges status)\r\nDo not provide clear goals and objective (challenges certainty)\r\n\r\nFair exchanges activate rewards circuitry. Unfair exchange activates danger circuit. How amazing is that! This value is not only an element of integrity, it also motivates us in the brain.\r\nOne fascinating fact about the relatedness pillar: The brain perceives the other, if we are not connected, as a threat. Connections make this perception go away. Does your team know each other or know you?\r\nWe cannot do justice to this theory in a small recap. You can find out more about David Rock and his work here.  \r\nIn the question and answer session, Tulin recommended two books: “How to Win Friends and Influence People” by Dale Carnegie and “Your Brain at Work: Strategies for Overcoming Distraction, Regaining Focus, and Working Smarter All Day Long” by David Rock.\r\nWe now have a great tool box for self-awareness, understanding our brain and the reaction of others, thank you Tülin Kahvecioğlu!\r\nYaprak Metin, our curator and brain trust member who introduced this topic amazing speaker and topic to us, ended the event with a call to all young professionals: ”You can’t find out how good you are until you spread your wings. Spread them wide open today!”\r\nYou can stay updated about upcoming TurkishWIN events by joining our newsletter here or joining us a TurkishWINer!

    "Title": "Academy Day: Coordinating with Others",
    "Version": 2,
    "Body": "We are in awe of our partner TUSIAD’s work and how this trailblazer NGO is paving the way for the business-government dialogue for a future-ready Turkey. \r\nSo when it was time to learn about the Coordinating with Others competency, we were delighted to hold our CampusWIN Academy Day at TUSIAD’s headquarters in Istanbul. \r\nThe day's schedule was as follows: \r\n\r\n09:30 -10:00 Breakfast & Welcome\r\n10:00- 10:30 Keynote speech by Dr. Bahadır Kaleağası, CEO, TÜSİAD\r\n10:30- 11:30 Coordinating with Others Panel moderated by Melek Pulatkonak with Elif Çelik, Executive Vice President, Healthcare Division - Eczacıbaşı Group; Zeynep Meydanoğlu, Country Director, Ashoka; and Melis Abacıoğlu, Director, Kızlar Sahada \r\n11:30- 11:45 Break \r\n11:45- 12:15 TurkishWIN & BinYaprak Updates \r\n12:15- 13:30 Lunch \r\n13:30- 14:45 CampusWIN Committee Presentations \r\n14:45- 15:00 Break \r\n15:00- 15:15 CampusWIN Sharing Circle \r\n15:15- 15:30 Gamification\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were blown away by Dr. Bahadır Kaleağası’s presentation of the global state of affairs ranging from the economic outlook to cyber warfare. His presentation made us first aware, then think about the influence and interconnected nature of the political, cultural and scientifical problems of our world. Dr. Kaleağası emphasized that we shouldn’t ignore the whole picture while looking closely at a local challenge, may it be in Turkey or in another case. \r\nFounded in 1971, the Turkish Industry and Business Association (TÜSİAD) is an independent, non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting public welfare through private enterprise. TUSİAD members constitute 70% of the commerce in Turkey and represent a significant rate of the economy. We were delighted for their recent name change and applaud them again.\r\nDr. Bahadır Kaleağası added that the only two things we should expect from governments for technological development are law and security. The rest of the responsibility lies with us and he left us to chew on this advice: While coordinating ideas, creativity and experience are vital skills. The only tool we need is our mind!\r\n\r\nOur Q&A was lively and one question about the recent SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and her precious cargo of stem cells made us all ponder if our coordination with others will extend to other worlds. For those who do not know, the Dragon experiment will investigate how stem cells react in microgravity, particularly examining how quickly these cells proliferate and differentiate.\r\nOur lively discussion with Elif Çelik, Zeynep Meydanoğlu, and Melis Abacıoğlu was moderated by Melek Pulatkonak. They all wore different hats: a CEO, an ecosystem builder and a social entrepreneur who shared their experiences. \r\nElif Çelik has been working at the Eczacıbaşı Group for years. For starters, she challenged each and every one of us to know our selves and added 'if you want to coordinate with others and expand your network, first you need to know yourself.' Her book recommendation Discover Your True North made it to our reading list. Elif added that coordinating with others in organizations depends on our ability to loosen the hierarchy, openness and increased level of democracy. When CampusWINners asked her opinion about traditional Turkish companies and when their culture of hierarchy - to coordinate especially with young talent- will change, her reply gave us hope as she said that Turkish companies are evolving. The strict hierarchy and non-flexibility in the corporate life will soon change- we must change.\r\nZeynep Meydancıoğlu of Ashoka Turkey shared how the social entrepreneurship ecosystem is evolving in collaboration in Turkey and how \"Coordinating with others is closely related with empathy and respect.\" She noted that we are moving from ego-system to ecosystems and recommended us to read Otto Scharmer’s free ebook, \"Leading from the Emerging Future: From Ego-system to Ecosystem.\" You can download this wonderful book here. Her second recommendation for us was to read Daniella Pappi’s thought piece on Tackling Heropreneurship: Why we need to move from the social entrepreneur to social impact. You can find more information here.\r\nMelis Abacıoğlu walked us through her experiences at Kızlar Sahada and her mistakes, a candid and high energy storytelling followed! She shared with us her journey of listening to 13-year old girls’empowerment stories as part of the group’s Imece pivot. Listening to others, knowing your true north and finding people to complement your skills were our takeaways from Melis’ experiences. \r\nWe thank all the panelists for joining us on a precious Saturday. We are inspired and indebted to you all! \r\nAfter a quick lunch break, our CampusWIN Committees presented their monthly updates and challenges. We are super excited to get all the team feedback on the action. All ears and eyes were on the recruiting committee updates as we are super excited to welcome the new CampusWINners to the sisterhood!\r\n \r\nAs customary, we held our sharing circle. We shared and shared and then congratulated a CampusWINNer for her acceptance for a research project at the Cambridge University, a to-graduate-soon WINner's new job offer to the PwC and hold our breath for another leader’s scholarship news for a Masters degree in Sweden. \r\nWe thank the wonderful TUSIAD team for hosting us this month. A special thanks goes to Kadir Yusuf Öztürk, who was with us the whole day!\r\nCheck out photos on Facebook here.\r\nNext month, another competency awaits us...",

His presentation made us first aware, then think about the influence and interconnected nature of the political, cultural and scientifical problems of our world. Dr. Kaleağası emphasized that we shouldn’t ignore the whole picture while looking closely at a local challenge, may it be in Turkey or&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">in&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">another case. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Founded in 1971, the Turkish Industry and Business Association (TÜSİAD) is an independent, non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting public welfare through private enterprise. TUSİAD members constitute 70% of the commerce in Turkey and represent a significant rate of the economy. We were delighted for their recent <a href=\"http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/leading-turkish-business-group-tusiad-changes-name-over-gender-concerns-125930\">name change</a> and applaud them again.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Dr. Bahadır Kaleağası added that the only two things we should expect from governments for technological development are law and security. The rest of the responsibility lies with us and he left us&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">to chew&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">on this advice: While coordinating ideas, creativity and experience are vital skills. The o</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">nly&nbsp;</span>tool<span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\"> we need is our mind!</span></span></p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images/30704961_1828746457172019_3513405723415412736_o.jpg\" alt=\"30704961 1828746457172019 3513405723415412736 o\" width=\"723\" height=\"483\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" /></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Our Q&amp;A was lively and one question about the recent SpaceX Dragon cargo spacecraft and her precious cargo of stem cells made us all ponder if our coordination with others will extend to other worlds. For those who do not know, the Dragon experiment will investigate how stem cells react in microgravity, particularly examining how quickly these cells proliferate and differentiate.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Our lively discussion with Elif Çelik, Zeynep Meydanoğlu, </span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">and&nbsp;</span><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;\">Melis Abacıoğlu was moderated by Melek Pulatkonak. They all wore different hats: a CEO, an ecosystem builder and a social entrepreneur who shared their experiences.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Elif Çelik has been working at the Eczacıbaşı Group for years. For starters, she challenged each and every one of us to know our selves and added 'if you want to coordinate with others and expand your network, first you need to know yourself.' Her book recommendation D<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-Expanded/dp/B01MFXDL80/ref=mt_audio_download?_encoding=UTF8&amp;me=Elif\">iscover Your True North</a>&nbsp;made it to our reading list. Elif added that coordinating with others in organizations depends on our ability to loosen the hierarchy, openness and increased level of democracy. When CampusWINners asked her opinion about traditional Turkish companies and when their culture of hierarchy - to coordinate especially with young talent- will change, her reply gave us hope as she said that Turkish companies are evolving. The strict hierarchy and non-flexibility in the corporate life will soon change- we must change.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Zeynep Meydancıoğlu of Ashoka Turkey shared how the social entrepreneurship ecosystem is evolving in collaboration in Turkey and how \"Coordinating with others is closely related with empathy and respect.\" She noted that we are moving from ego-system to ecosystems and recommended us to read Otto Scharmer’s free ebook, \"Leading from the Emerging Future: From Ego-system to Ecosystem.\" You can download this wonderful book <a href=\"http://www.ottoscharmer.com/sites/default/files/e2e_ulab.pdf\">here</a>. Her second recommendation for us was to read Daniella Pappi’s thought piece on Tackling Heropreneurship: Why we need to move from the social entrepreneur to social impact. You can find more information <a href=\"http://tacklingheropreneurship.com\">here</a>.</span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">Melis Abacıoğlu walked us through her experiences at Kızlar Sahada and her mistakes, a candid and high energy storytelling followed! She shared with us her journey of listening to 13-year old girls’empowerment stories as part of the group’s Imece pivot. Listening to others, knowing your true north and finding people to complement your skills were our takeaways from Melis’ experiences. </span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">We thank all the panelists for joining us on a precious Saturday.

We shared and shared and then congratulated a CampusWINNer for her acceptance for a research project at the Cambridge University, a to-graduate-soon WINner's new job offer to the PwC and hold our breath for another leader’s scholarship news for a Masters degree in Sweden. </span></span></p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12pt; color: #000000;\">We thank the wonderful TUSIAD team for hosting us this month.
